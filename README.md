# Borgs

The project is based on using REST APIs. There's a few step to run the code.

1- you first need to make a copy of the repo and go on terminal. Create 2 separate terminals, one for the api, and one for the frontend folder. You will need to run a few libraries and packages if you want to run the code.
2- After making two terminals. run the api first by using: "yarn start" if you downloaded all the packages and saying an issue with authentication, then the cluster of mongodb atlas needs update/another one.
3- You would want to first make a cluster on mongodb atlas, then copy it and put it under .nev on backend. Note: you need to add your username and password you create in the link.
4- after that is working, go to the frontend and say: "yarn start" you would need to download packages as well. After everything is working it should take you to a login page/sign up. make a login and enjoy the site.
